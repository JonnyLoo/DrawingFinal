The homepage will be 3 doors, each leading to a different scene. When you click on a door, it will take you to one of three scenes...a beach, a jungle, or outer space. The first scene, the beach, is a scene where there's an ocean and clouds moving in the background, with the shoreline being visible. There's a shark swimming around in the ocean and footprints that disappear and reappear on the beach. Its set in the third person view. The second scene, the jungle, is surrounded with trees, with a small opening revealing some bugs/animals crawling around on the floor. The sun rises and sets in the background changing the contents of the scene depending on what time of day it is. The viewer is places right outside the opening, peering into the opening from a first person view. The last scene, outer space, is just the viewer floating around in space, with stars in the background, and a spaceship that zooms into the scene (hyperspeed/warp drive). There is also some arbitrary planets visible in the background that are spinning slowly. There will also be several pieces of space junk floating around and a little ufo that briefly appears then disappears.
